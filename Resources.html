        <h1>What is Mucormycosis?</h1>
        <p>
            Mucormycosis (sometimes called zygomycosis) is a serious but rare fungal infection caused by a group of molds called mucormycetes. These fungi live throughout the environment. They live in soil and in decaying organic matter, such as leaves, compost piles, or rotten wood.1
            
            People get mucormycosis by coming in contact with the fungal spores in the environment. For example, infections involving the lung or sinus can occur after someone breathes in spores. These forms of mucormycosis usually occur in people who have health problems or take medicines that lower the body’s ability to fight germs and sickness.2,3
            
            Types of mucormycosis
            Rhinocerebral (sinus and brain) mucormycosis is an infection in the sinuses that can spread to the brain. This is most common in people with uncontrolled diabetes and in people who have had a kidney transplant.
            Pulmonary (lung) mucormycosis is the most common type of mucormycosis in people with cancer and in people who have had an organ transplant or a stem cell transplant.
            Gastrointestinal mucormycosis is more common among young children than adults. Premature and low-birth-weight infants less than 1 month of age are at risk if they have had antibiotics, surgery, or medications that lower the body’s ability to fight germs and sickness.6-7
            Cutaneous (skin) mucormycosis occurs after the fungi enter the body through a break in the skin. This type of infection might occur after a burn, scrape, cut, surgery, or other types of skin trauma. This is the most common form of mucormycosis among people who do not have weakened immune systems.
            Disseminated mucormycosis occurs when the infection spreads through the bloodstream to affect another part of the body. The infection most commonly affects the brain, but also can affect other organs such as the spleen, heart, and skin.
